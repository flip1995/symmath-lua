Symbolic Math library for Lua

Goals:

- Everything done in pure Lua / Lua syntax.  No/minimal parsing.
- Originally intended for computational physics.  Implement equations in Lua, perform symbolic manipulation, generate functions (via symmath.compile)

Example used at http://christopheremoore.net/metric

TODO


- solving equalities
- integrals.  symbolic, numeric explicit, then eventually get to numeric implicit (this involves derivatives based on both the dependent and the state variable)

- functions that lua has that I don't: abs, ceil, floor, deg, rad, fmod, frexp, log10, min, max

- support for numbers rather than only Constant

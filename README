symbolic math library for lua

capable of solving and simplifying
could use a good polynomial division routine

I've successfully used this to check my work calculating connection coefficients of metrics for geodesic integration

demo at http://christopheremoore.net/symbolic-lua


operations (and their respective operator precedence)
prune:	div	add mul
expand:	add div mul
factor: mul add div



TODO

- support for numbers rather than only Constant
- better simplify() that could actually run multiple iterations and compare start to current state successfully without infinite tail calls
- replace a variable's "deferDiff" with a list of dependent variables, for which to defer differentiation (reduce to kronecher delta otherwise)

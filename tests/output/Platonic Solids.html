$n =$ dimension of manifold which our shape resides in.<br>
$\tilde{T}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} =$ i'th isomorphic transform in the minimal set.<br>
$\tilde{\textbf{T}} = \{ 1 \le i \le p, \tilde{T}_i \} =$ minimum set of isomorphic transforms that can be used to recreate all isomorphic transforms.<br>
$p = |\tilde{\textbf{T}}| =$ the number of minimal isomorphic transforms.<br>
$T_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} =$ i'th isomorphic transform in the set of all unique transforms.<br>
$\textbf{T} = \{ T_i \} = \{ 1 \le k, i_1, ..., i_k \in [1,m], \tilde{T}_{i_1} \cdot ... \cdot \tilde{T}_{i_k} \} =$ set of all unique isomorphic transforms.<br>
$q = |\textbf{T}| =$ the number of unique isomorphic transforms.<br>
$v_1 \in \mathbb{R}^n =$ some arbitrary initial vertex.<br>
$\textbf{v} = \{v_i \} = \{ T_i \cdot v_1 \} =$ the set of all vertices.<br>
$m = |\textbf{v}| =$ the number of vertices.<br>
(Notice that $m \le q$, i.e. the number of vertices is $\le$ the number of unique isomorphic transforms.) <br>
$V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}=$ matrix with column vectors the set of all vertices, such that $V_{ij} = (v_j)_i$.<br>
$P_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m} =$ permutation transform of vertices corresponding with i'th transformation, such that $T_i V = V P_i$.<br>

Notice that isomorphic transform group size = number of surface elemnts x the group size of the surface element.<br>
Duals have different numbers of polyhedron sides and numbers of polygon sides, despite having matching group size.<br>
The tetrahdron have 4 sides and are made of triangles of group size 3, and has a group size of $3 \cdot 4 = 12$.  It is self-dual.<br>
The cube has 6 sides and is made of squares of group size 4, and it has a group size of $6 \cdot 4 = 24$.<br>
The octahedron has 8 sides and is made of squares of group size 3, and it has a group size of $8 \cdot 3 = 24$.  The cube and octahedron are duals and have matching group sizes.<br>
